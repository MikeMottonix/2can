THE API
------------

First:
- put `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://2can-api.glitch.me/css">` in your head element
- (maintenance) include the script 

Then you can:
- create styled element's without doing CSS
- change the default color by adding `?color=(HEX CODE)` 
  eg.
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://2can-api.glitch.me/css?color=000fff">
  ```
- set website name with JS `var name=(name)`
